Hello ! I am Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias, currently a student of the Economic Research Master of Sciences Po, in Paris. Willing to pursue in the Economic Research, my goal with this Website is to be able to efficiently present my work, skills and other eventual material. Additional material is always being added !

I have a double bachelor degree in social sciences and political science between Sciences Po and the Freie Universit√§t.
I also have obtained a bachelor degree in economics at the University of Lorraine, in Nancy.
I am currently in my second year of Master in Economics in the Research School of Sciences Po.
You can access my [english CV here](./Resources/CV/CV_en.pdf) and my [french CV here](./Resources/CV/CV_fr.pdf).

In the "Projects" section, you can see some of the projects I undertook during my Master.
