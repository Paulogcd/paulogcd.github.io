\section{A Behavioral Model}
Let's ignore the first two equations, since they are the same as (28) and (29), that will be explained later.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{Equation 1}

\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ x_{t+1} -\sigma (i_{t}-\mathbb{E}_t\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})\right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Equation 2}

\begin{equation}
    \pi_{t}=\beta\cdot M^{f} \mathbb{E}_t\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]+\kappa\cdot x_{t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Basic Setup and the Householdâ€™s Problem}

\subsubsection*{Equation 3}

\begin{equation}
    U = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t}\left(\frac{c_{t}^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma} - \frac{N_{t}^{1+\phi}}{1+\phi}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (3) is just the flow utility of the Household, with : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ the discount factor
    \item $c_{t}$ the consumption of the houshold at time $t$
    \item $N_{t}$ the work of the household at time $t$
    \item $\gamma$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to the consumption, i.e. the importance of consumption in the utility function
    \item $\phi$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to work, i.e. the importance of work in the utility function
\end{itemize}

%There is some computation between (3) and (4) !!!%

\subsubsection*{Equation 4}

\begin{equation}
    k_{t+1}=(1+r_t)(k_{t}-c_{t}+y_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (4) is the law of motion of the real financial wealth of the household, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k_t$ is the real financial welath of the household at time $t$
    \item $r_t$ is the real interest rate
    \item $w_t$ is the real wage
    \item $y_t$ is the agent's real income, defined as $y_t=w_t\cdot N_{t}+y_{t}^{f}$, with $y_{t}^{f}$ the profit income (or the income from firms) at time $t$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 5}

\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}_{t+1}=\bm{G}^{\bm{X}}\left(\bm{X}_{t},\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1}\right)
\end{equation}

Equation (5) describes the evolution of macroeconomic variables, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bm{X}_t$ is the state vector, including several macroeconomic variables of time $t$, like $\zeta_t$ the aggregate TFP, and the announced actions in monetary and fiscal policy
    \item $\bm{G}^X$ the equilibrium transition function, i.e. the function that gives the macroeconomic variables at time $t+1$ from the macroeconomic variables at the previous period
    \item $\epsilon_{t}$ is the innovation in the economy at time $t$, with $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\epsilon_{t+1}\right]=0$, that depends on the equilibrium policies of the agent and of the government
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 6}

\begin{equation}
    k_{t+1}=G^{k}(c_{t},N_{t}, k_{t}, \bm{X}_t):= (1+\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t}))(k_{t}+\bar{y}+\hat{y}(N_{t},\bm{X}_t)-c_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (6) is the application of the consideration of a set of macroeconomic variables on the law of motion of real financial wealth $k_{t}$, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{r}$ is the steady state value of the real interest rate, that does not depend on time
    \item $\hat{r}(\bm{X}_t)$ is the value of the deviation from the steady state of the real interest rate, that depends on the state vector $\bm{X}_{t}$ at time $t$
    \item $\bar{y}$ is the steady state value of the agent's real income, that does not depend on time
    \item $\hat{y}(N_{t},\bm{X}_{t})$ is the deviation from the steady state of the agent's real income, that depends on the number of hours worked at time $t$ and on the state vector at time $t$
    \item $c_{t}$ is the aggregate consumption level at time $t$ of the agent
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 7}

\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}_{t+1}=\bm{\Gamma}\bm{X}_{t}+\bm{epsilon}_{t+1}
\end{equation}

Equation (7) describes the linear version of the equilibrium transition function, it is the linearization of the law of motion, where :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Gamma$ is a squared matrix that multiplies the state vector
    \item $\bm{X}_t$ is the state vector at time t
    \item $\epsilon_{t}$ is the innovation shock
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 8 (Assumption 1)}

\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}_{t+1}=\bar{m}\cdot\bm{G}^{\bm{X}}(\bm{X}_{t},\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1})
\end{equation}

Equation (8) describes the Cognitive Discounting of the State Vector, i.e. the perception by behavioral agents of the law of motion of the macroeconomic variables, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{m}\in\left[0,1\right]$ is the cognitive discount factor measuring the attention to the future
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 9}

\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}_{t+1}=\bar{m}(\bm{\Gamma}\bm{X}_{t}+\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1})
\end{equation}

Equation (9) is just the linearized version of the perception by behavioral agents of the law of motion of the state vector. 

\subsubsection*{Equation 10}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{BR}\left[\bm{X}_{t+k}\right]=\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\bm{X}_{t+k}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (10) defines the expectation of behavioral agents in function of the rational perception of the law of motion of the state vector, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context

    \item $\bar{m}^{k}$ is the cognitive discounting effect at period $t+k$
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\bm{X}_{t+k}\right]$ is the rational expectation of the state vector at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 11 (Lemma 1)}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{BR}\left[z\left(\bm{X}_{t+k}\right)\right]=\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[z\left(\bm{X}_{t+k}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (11) defines in the general case the behavioral expectation operator, for any function of the state vector, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context
    \item $z(\cdot)$ is a function, such that $z(0)=0$
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}^{BR}\left[z\left(\bm{X}_{t+k}\right)\right]$ is the expected value of the image of the state vector by the function $z(\cdot)$ at time $t+k$ by behavioral agents
    \item $\bar{m}^{k}$ is the cognitive discounting effect at period $t+k$
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[z\left(\bm{X}_{t+k}\right)\right]$ is the rational expectation of the image of the state vector by the function $z(\cdot)$ at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 12}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{BR}\left[\bar{r}+\hat{r}\left(\bm{X}_{t+k}\right)\right]=\bar{r}+\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t+k})\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (12) is an example of the Lemma 1 applied to the interest rate, where :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context
    \item $\bar{r}$ the steady state level of the real interest rate, that does not depend on time,  
    \item $\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t+k})$ is the equilibrium transition function defining the value of the deviation from the steady state of the real interest rate in function of the state vector at time $t+k$
    \item $\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t})=r_{t}(\bm{X}_{t})$ is the value of the real interest rate at time $t$
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}^{BR}\left[\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t+k})\right]$ is the expected value of the real interest at time $t+k$ by behavioral agents
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t+k})\right]$ is the rational expectation of value of the deviation of the real itnerest rate from the steady state at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}
